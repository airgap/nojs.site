# [NoJS Site](https://nojs.site)
An example site that uses absolutely no JavaScript, just CSS.

Currently it's just an adaptive navbar, but I'll add more content over time. Some parts of the site have practical uses, like how a checkbox is used to toggle the bar's drop state. Other parts are less practical, like the ridiculously overcomplicated hover effects.
